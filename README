   Source codes. Including:

   Circuit.h:
      Define the classes for circuit objects and class CircuitMgr. The read-in circuit is store in CircuitMgr and most of the functions in this program are the member function of it.

   Circuit.cpp:
      Define the basis member functions of the classes. Also define the functions to build a graph by scanning the circuit on both dimension and looking for overlapped objects.

   io.cpp:
      Functions for read in the input file and write the output file.

   Graph.h/cpp:
      Define the classes for building a graph. The graph is to find trivial connections between object and to check for disjoint sets.

   path.cpp:
      Functions to apply Hadlock's algorithm to find an optimal path between between two given points.


Unsolved problems:
   * Minimum spanning tree for finding effective edges and add them as Lines.
   * The seconding scanning for overlapping, looking for trivial connections between Shapes and the new built Lines.
   * Collecting disjoint sets and find the best points pair to connect them.
   * Way to find Vias.
   * Simple test cases to verify logical correction.
   * Class presentation and paper report.
