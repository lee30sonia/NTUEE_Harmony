Directories:
bin/:
   Executable files.
   - cada057: optimized version
   - net_open_finder_dbg: debug version
   - eval: evaluation program released by CAD
   - eval_2: evaluation program version.2 released by CAD (6/12)
lib/:
   Time and memory usage library.
inputs/:
   Simple testing input created by us (simple1) and
   benchmarks released by CAD (benchmarks/).
src/:
   Source codes. Including:

   Circuit.h:
      Define the classes for circuit objects and class CircuitMgr. The read-in circuit is store in CircuitMgr and most of the functions in this program are the member function of it.

   Circuit.cpp:
      Define the basic member functions of the classes. Also define the functions to build a graph by scanning the circuit on both dimension and looking for overlapped objects.

   io.cpp:
      Functions for read in the input file and write the output file.

   Graph.h/cpp:
      Define the classes for building a graph. The graph is to find trivial connections between object and to check for disjoint sets.

   path.cpp:
      Functions to apply Hadlock's algorithm to find an optimal path between between two given points.
   
   Greedy.cpp:
      Implementation of the whole combined algorithm.
      
   makefile:
      Need C++11 and gcc version at least 4.6 (for multi-thread library omp.h).


Usage:
   1. To compile:
   - make: creates binary file ../bin/cada057 (optimized version with multi-threading)
   - make dbg: creates binary file ../bin/net_open_finder_dbg (debug version. If you don't have gcc 4.6, use this.)
   - make clean: remove all object files, binary files, and output files.
   
   2. To exacute / To evaluate result:
   - ./[cada057 | net_open_finder_dbg | eval | eval_2] <input file> <output file>
   ***If you do not have C++11, do not "make clean" and try the binary files we provide.
